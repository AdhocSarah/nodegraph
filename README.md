# nodegraph

A node graph utility inspired by tools like [GraphOnline](https://graphonline.ru/en/). Built using [Processing](https://processing.org/), with additional library [UiBooster](https://github.com/milchreis/uibooster-for-processing). 

Current Functionality:
* Node creation
* Node linking (with weights and directionality)
* Click-and-drag movement of nodes

Future Goals:
* Replace linear links with arcs
* Prevent node stacking
* Display directionality
* Provide algorithmic functionality
  * Prim's
  * Kruskal's
  * etc.
